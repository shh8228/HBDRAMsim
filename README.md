# HBDRAMsim




## Building and running the simulator

This simulator has been built based on DRAMsim3.
Follow the below instructions of DRAMsim3 to build the environment.
For details, goto link below:
https://github.com/umd-memsys/DRAMsim3/tree/master

### Building

We require CMake 3.0+ to build this simulator.
Doing out of source builds with CMake is recommended to avoid the build files cluttering the main directory.

```bash
# cmake out of source build
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

# Build dramsim3 library and executables
make -j4

```

The build process creates `dramsim3main` and executables in the `build` directory.
By default, it also creates `libdramsim3.so` shared library in the project root directory.

### Running an example workload
You can immediately run HB-NPU with a sample trace of 128x128x128 matrix multiplication using the below command.
```bash
./build/dramsim3main configs/HBM2_8Gb_x128.ini -c 5000000 -t sample.trc
```
You can check the simulation results immediately.
```bash
3374 End of Computation 0 
3409 Output Exhausted. Array0 Turn off PIM mode. # Completed operations in 3409 cycles.
Turn off PIM
```
You can see the command trace and statistics in ```dramsim3ch_[0-7]cmd.trace``` and ```dramsim3.txt```.
Command trace shows the cycles and addresses of executed operations with their command types.

The command statistics shows the number of pim commands, their row hits, and energy, etc.
```bash
num_pim_read_row_hits          =        10094   # Number of read row buffer hits
...
num_pim_read_cmds              =        10272   # Number of READ/READP commands
...
pim_read_energy                =  1.08472e+06   # Read energy
```
### Running a custom workload
Firstly, you should make workload file of matmul kernel. 

Example of 128x256x1 GEMV with (mcf,ucf) = (2,8) :
```bash
1, 1, 2048, 8, 2, 8, 1 
128, 256, 1
```
**First line format**: ```1 (fixed), 1 (fixed), Accumulation_buffer_depth, 8 (fixed), mcf, ucf, dataflow_option``` 

Fixed values are reserved for future works that are under the development.

dataflow option is 0 for Weight stationary GEMM kernel, 1 for Input stationary GEMV kernel.

With GEMM kernel workload, you can use the mcf value as the number of multi-columns and should fix ucf as 1.

For example, 128x256x512 GEMM kernel workload with 4 multicolumns is:
```bash
1, 1, 2048, 8, 4, 1, 0
128, 256, 512
```


**Second line format**: ```M, K, N``` for MxKxN GEMM kernel; ```M, K, 1``` for GEMV kernel of MxK matrix and Kx1 vector 

With the workload file you can generate transaction traces that will go into DRAMsim program by running below command.
It divides and reshapes the operand data and allocates them to the physical address of the bank.
Then you can now run HB-NPU with the generated trace file like the above.
```bash
python gen_pim_trace2.py -f False -w [workload_path]
./build/dramsim3main configs/HBM2_8Gb_x128.ini -c 5000000 -t sample.trc
```
Each trace line in a trace file is composed of memory address, transaction type, and cycle time to execute the transaction.
```bash
0x2f0060	PIM	0 # set variables such as mcf, ucf, dataflow option, etc.
0xc8800000a000	PIM	1 # set dimension M and physical (starting) address of weight
0x5020	PIM	2 # set dimension K and physical (starting) address of output
0x840	PIM	3 # set dimension N and physical (starting) address of input
0x3	PIM	4 # launch computation
```
Unlike the normal DRAM access transactions, PIM transactions are not directly translated to the DRAM commands because the management of transactions in DRAMsim3 does not fit into HB-NPU control system.
Instead, our transaction address contains the information about the workload to run, physical addresses of matrices, and dataflow configuration, etc and commands are dynamically generated by PIM command scheduler we have implemented.
We elaborated the simulator design in later section.


## Simulator Design

It assumes _one transaction accesses only one channel and one bank_, just as noraml DRAM access but HB-NPU accesses several banks in several channel simultaneously.

PIM command scheduler then stores these informations in registers and generates PIM commands dynamically based on the registers.
This control scheme is possible because matrix multiplication has regular access pattern unlike the normal DRAM access.

The transaction in first line 

Each channel controller has its own transaction queue and individually manages and generates the commands. (refer to the workflow diagram below.)
HB-NPU accesses several banks in several channel simultaneously and needs . 

BLSA command generating
DRAM command added -> different timing constraints, different power calculation -> report
refreshing

The other challenge is that DRAM controllers manage the command queue in dynamic way, so the commands can be executed out of order for higher command throughput, which is not problematic in normal access but dependency in PNM operations is not considered.
Each transaction 
this trace format hinders dynamic execution of memory transactions since the execution timing is deterministic.
Especially in Originally in DRAMsim3,

## Experiments

### Verilog Validation

First we generate a DRAM command trace.
There is a `CMD_TRACE` macro and by default it's disabled.
Use `cmake .. -DCMD_TRACE=1` to enable the command trace output build and then
whenever a simulation is performed the command trace file will be generated.

Next, `scripts/validation.py` helps generate a Verilog workbench for Micron's Verilog model
from the command trace file.
Currently DDR3, DDR4, and LPDDR configs are supported by this script.

Run

```bash
./script/validataion.py DDR4.ini cmd.trace
```

To generage Verilog workbench.
Our workbench format is compatible with ModelSim Verilog simulator,
other Verilog simulators may require a slightly different format.
